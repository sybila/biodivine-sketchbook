This is a collection of various sketches and relevant models that may be useful for testing/validation, or for future experiments. 

These models come from the following sources:
- `myeloid` contains model and data coming from the following two papers: [Hierarchical Differentiation of Myeloid Progenitors Is Encoded in the Transcription Factor Network](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022649) (original work), [A Method to Identify and Analyze Biological Programs through Automated Reasoning](10.1038/npjsba.2016.10) (follow-up work)
- `oscillatory_models` is a collection of sketches used in the thesis [Reconstructing Boolean Network Models of Systems with Complex Oscillatory Dynamics](https://is.muni.cz/th/t1f43/) by Oto Stanko
