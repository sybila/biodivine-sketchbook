/// the presence of the `regulator` affects the value of the `target`:
///  - if the regulation is `positive`, it might only *increase* the `target` value
///  - if the regulation is `negative`, it might only *decrease* the `target` value
///  - if the regulation is `dual`, it might both *increase* or *decrease* the `target` value (in
///    different contexts)
///
/// If essentiality is set to *true*, the `regulator` *must* have influence on the outcome
/// of the `target` update function in *some* context. If set to `False`, this regulation must have
/// no effect. If it is `Unknown`, the essentiality is not enforced (i.e. the `regulator` *can*
/// have an influence on the `target`, but it is not required).
///
/// Regulations can be represented as strings in the
/// form `"regulator_name 'relationship' target_name"`. The 'relationship' starts with `-`, which
/// is followed by `>` for activation (positive monotonicity), `|` for inhibition (negative
/// monotonicity), `*` for dual effect (non-monotonic) or `?` for unspecified monotonicity.
/// Finally, an additional `X`, `?` at the end of 'relationship' signifies that the the regulation
/// is non-essential (non-essential) or the essentiality is unknown, respectively.
/// Together, this gives the following options:  `->, ->?, -|, -|?, -*, -*?, -?, -??`.
